|-------|-----|---------|
|  -[#35](https://github.com/UCSB-CS56-Projects/cs56-games-battleship/issues/35)  | 100 | The sound effects crash on CSIL Machines after 30 or so times |
|  #34  | 300 | Revamp the GUI |
|  #27  | 500 | Improve the Boat Sizes and Sapes to something besides rectangles   |
|  #42  | 100 | Add test coverage. Simulate games   |
|  #15  | 100 | Allow the user to return to the main menus if already entered another screen |

* The issues add up to 1100, but strongly believe #15 should be worth more.
