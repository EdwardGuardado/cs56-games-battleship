<b>TODO</b> - add more description to the sections of this README

This is a version of the game Battleship. 

* Original developer description - the Milton Bradley board game that has won the hearts of children for over four decades. It will be single-player (vs. computer) and will have various difficulty settings (easy, normal, hard).  You can also host/join games and play against your friends online WITH THE POWER OF JAVA NETWORKING!

* Current version: 2.1
* Previous versions:
	* version 1: See "Original developer description"
	* version 2.0: New feature added. Player can customize ship sizes in the "against computer" mode through a new window. Illegal ship sizes will be reported to the player.
	* version 2.1: New feature added. There will be a hit count under the game board indicating how many pixels on the opponent's ship has the player already hit.
	* version 2.1.1: Bug fix on checking ship sizes validity. In version 2.0, if user input is not a number, program will terminate. Now fixed.
