a) A player chooses 5 different sized ships, and then places thoes ships on a grid, which will be hidden to 
the other player/computer. The players then take turns guessing the coordinates of the competitor's ships, until someone
"hits" all of the other person's ships.

b) As a user, I can host a game so that another player can join using my IP address.
    As a user, I can enter the IP address of another computer that is a hosting a game so that I can play against them.
    As a user, I can play a game against the computer so that I do not need to wait for another player.
    As a user, I can select the color of my ships when playing against the computer.
    As a user, I can choose the 1D size (between 2 and 9) of 5 different ships when playing against the computer.
    As a user, I can select among three different difficulty levels when playing against the computer. 
    As a user, I can select where on my grid to place my ships so that my competitor will not know.
    As a user, I can chang the orientation of my ships usenig the arrow keys to increase difficulty for my competitor.
    As a user, I can guess a coordinate of my opponent's grid, and receive feedback on whether I hit or missed a ship.

c) The software runs well. The IP connection works, and playing against the computer works. Unable to test sound due to 
    lack of speakers.
    
d) As a user, I would like to have a back button when setting up a game so that I can fix mistakes.
    As a user, I would like to be able to exit a game and return to the home page.
    As a user, I would like to have better visuals for the ships.
    As a user, I would like a tally for how many boats my opponent and I have sunk.
    As a programmer, I would like to edit the IP address that is displayed to remove everything after the colon
    so that it is easier for a user to join a game with another player.
    
e) The README.md is of good quality. It is easy to understand, and covers all the information you need to know.

f) The build.xml file is in good shape. Each target has an accurate description.

g) There are plenty of issues for this project, as well as issues that we have come up with ourselves. It is definitely possible to accumulate 1000 points with these issues.
