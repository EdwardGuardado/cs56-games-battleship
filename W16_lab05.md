(a) Brief Description of the project:
    It is a version of the classic board game Battleship with LAN multiplayer and computer player functionality.
(b) A set of user stories based on what it currently can do:
    As someone who would like to play Battleship alone, I would like to play against a CPU so that I do not need to find another player.
    As someone who would like to play Battleship with a friend, I want multiplayer capabilities so that I could play with my friend.
(c) Assessment of whether the software runs or not, and what it does:
    The software runs very well. It is a version of the board game Battleship that allows you to play against a computer
        against another human on a local network. Against a human the types of ships are fixed, but against a computer you can
        choose what size ships you would like to use, and the computer uses the same size ships as you do.
(c2) Set of user stories that could be added:
    As a player who would like to have a more immersive experience, I would like to hear sound effects so it is like I am in the game.
    As a player who would like to be challenged, I would like the hard difficulty to be harder so that I have more fun.
    As a player with a creative mind, I would like to choose my ships color so that the game is more visually appealing.
    As a player, I would like for there to be a play again button to make replaying easier.
    
    


Things to work on:
    Adding sound effects
    Including a play again button
    Increasing computer hard difficulty (giving it all
        coords of ships and then giving it some more
        random coords to choose from)
    Making it so there is a minimum and a limit to # of blocks
        in computer mode
    Making ship size error message more professional
    There is little to no test coverage so we will be adding
        more tests. We will also create a standalone test class
        as the test method is currently sitting in BattleshipGUI
    Clean up the build.xml (Remove publish, add descriptions to many tasks)
    Fix typos in javadoc "comptuer" in Computer Class
