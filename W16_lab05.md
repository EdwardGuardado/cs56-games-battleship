Things to work on:
    Adding sound effects
    Including a play again button
    Increasing computer hard difficulty (giving it all
        coords of ships and then giving it some more
        random coords to choose from)
    Making it so there is a minimum and a limit to # of blocks
        in computer mode
    Making ship size error message more professional
    There is little to no test coverage so we will be adding
        more tests. We will also create a standalone test class
        as the test method is currently sitting in BattleshipGUI
    Clean up the build.xml (Remove publish, add descriptions to many tasks)
    Fix typos in javadoc "comptuer" in Computer Class
